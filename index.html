			<hr>
			<p>
				I'm Ogunniyi Oluwatobi Ifedayo, born on January 13, 1998, in the heart
				of Oyo town, Nigeria. I Graduated from the department of English
				Education at the University of Ibadan in the year 2021. Currently, I
				work as a Field Technician Support at Choice2Mobile, where I utilize my
				technical skills to provide top-notch support to clients. However, my
				true aspiration is to become a skilled backend developer, where I can
				merge my creativity with innovative technology. When I'm not
				problem-solving or coding, you can find me singing along to my favorite
				tunes, exploring virtual realms in video games, or getting lost in the
				pages of a great book. Music, gaming, and reading are my go-to escapes,
				fueling my imagination and creativity. I'm driven by a determination to
				succeed, resilience in the face of challenges, and a passion for
				continuous learning. I'm excited to see where my journey takes me and
				how I can make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
